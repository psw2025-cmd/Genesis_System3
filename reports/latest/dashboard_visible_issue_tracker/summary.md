## Rule
Every live sidebar tab must be scanned and its asynchronous content must settle before PASS. A timed-out tab is still captured but is recorded as ASYNC_CONTENT_NOT_SETTLED. Visible UI blockers remain TODO until automated UI proof shows they are gone. Informational NO TRADE / MARKET CLOSED / LIVE OFF lines are recorded separately and do not count as blocker unless paired with ERROR/FAIL/PENDING/MISSING/STALE/AUTH/0/4.
